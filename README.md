# About this project

My attempt at isolating the code required for collecting checkbox values from an Angular reactive form, with no extra code which might make these basics more difficult to understand. That said, the code does utilise FormBuilder which does remove a layer of transparency.

Kudos to Netanel Basal and [his tutorial](https://netbasal.com/handling-multiple-checkboxes-in-angular-forms-57eb8e846d21) on reactive Angular checkbox forms. Please visit it for additional commentary that might help you wrap your head around these concepts.
